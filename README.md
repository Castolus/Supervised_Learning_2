# Supervised_Learning_2

Classification Training for Dataset of 3 Diferent Penguin Species. In order to execute, we must copy the "kaggle.json" file in the Root directory of your Google Drive Profile.

Description
The project can be passed by submitting only the work done in sprints 1, 2 and 3. The assignment below is optional, and to qualify for a higher grade in the module.

The deliverable should consist of a PDF file of a Colab notebook that brings together the work done on penguin data throughout the weekly sprints. The "Print - Save as PDF" option in Google Colab allows saving a notebook as a PDF file. 

IMPORTANT: No 'ipynb" files will be accepted or evaluated; the deliverable must be an exported PDF version of the notebook. However, if any table or visualization appears cut off and does not display correctly in the PDF, you may attach it as a screenshot in your contribution in the project forum and it will be evaluated along with your PDF.

Project phases: 

 

Phase 1: Weekly Sprint 1

Phase 2: Weekly Sprint 2

Phase 3: Weekly sprint 3

Additional phase:

OPTIONAL: Extend the work done in the three sprint, selecting the 1-2 best classifiers found, and trying a hyperparameter search method (grid search, random search, seen in class 1 and the masterclass) to check if there is any even better configuration of your selected model(s). Discuss and briefly document in your own notebook (pdf) the results obtained.
